# 2048
Console based 2048 with nxn matrix selection option.
Build as a hobby project which replicates 2048 game, only difference is it does not contains graphics as 
it is played on linux console.
Unlike 2048 game found on playstore, in this game I have given player the option to enter the size of matrix 
in which he/she wants to play and maintains the leadersboard.
It has less comments, needs code refactoring as it can be made more elegant and readable.
